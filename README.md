# Gettysburg-Gamers-Website
Hi all, this is a website I made for my group of friends.
Named after the discord that we are apart of, it showcases my knowledge of different html concepts and allows for me to
  have a workspace to learn various web-programming techniques to my hearts desire.
  
  With that said --- THIS IS NOT A PROFFESIONAL PROJECT and should not be treated as such. 
  
  Sincerely,
  Brandon
